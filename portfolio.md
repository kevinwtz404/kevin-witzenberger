## genAI arcade: interactive ai literacy platform

Understanding generative AI is challenging when most resources are either too technical, gloss over environmental costs, or present apocalyptic scenarios. The GenAI Arcade addresses this gap by letting people learn about AI through direct engagement and experimentation.

The platform features interactive games that reveal both AI capabilities and limitations. Users experiment with different AI systems, testing boundaries and exploring what happens when pushed in unexpected directions. No technical background or coding knowledge required.

### approach

* **Learning through experimentation:** Direct interaction with AI systems rather than theoretical explanations
* **Critical engagement:** Addresses environmental costs, corporate accountability, and realistic limitations alongside capabilities
* **Practical skills development:** Teaches better prompting, when to choose AI over simpler tools, and how to evaluate AI outputs
* **Participatory framework:** Empowers users to make informed decisions about AI adoption and hold developers accountable

### outcomes

The platform helps users develop practical AI literacy: writing better prompts, understanding environmental trade-offs, seeing through marketing claims, and making informed decisions about when to use or avoid AI tools.

### technical implementation

Built using modular Gradio applications with custom AI integrations. Designed for adaptability across organisational contexts.

## ai literacy & professional development

**Faculty Development Sessions** - Interactive discussions on generative AI capabilities, challenges, and implications for academic work. Sessions cover the distinction between analytical and generative AI, productivity applications, and critical reflections on environmental costs and responsible use.

**Interactive AI Architecture Sessions** - Tactile workshops where participants experience transformer architecture by acting out computational processes, providing an accessible way to understand the mechanics behind systems like ChatGPT.

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Workshops** - Technical workshops teaching participants to build their own RAG systems, vectorise databases, and explore how to augment large language models with custom data.

## policy development & advisory

Research cited in 18 policy documents from organisations including UNESCO and the European Commission, with input to policy decisions at state and federal levels across Australia and Europe. This includes public engagement with European policymakers through lectures on automation to the Green Party's Bildung working group in Berlin.

Education Futures Studio: Co-founded research initiative recognised by government agencies as a leading voice in AI policy. Provided academic advisory work on the NSW Framework for Generative AI in Schools, adopted across the NSW school system affecting hundreds of thousands of students.
