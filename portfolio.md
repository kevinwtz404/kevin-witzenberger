## GenAI Arcade: Interactive AI Literacy Platform

**Challenge:** Most AI education is either too technical for general users or too superficial to be useful. People need hands-on experience to understand AI capabilities and limitations, but existing resources don't bridge this gap effectively.

**Solution:** I developed GenAI Arcadeâ€”an interactive platform that lets people learn about AI by actually using it. Rather than reading about AI, users experiment with different AI systems through guided activities and games.

### What It Does
- **Learning Through Interaction:** Users engage directly with AI systems to understand how they work
- **Critical Literacy:** Addresses not just capabilities but also limitations, environmental costs, and responsible use
- **Accessible Design:** No technical background required, but provides genuine understanding
- **Practical Focus:** Teaches when to use AI, when to avoid it, and how to use it effectively

### Technical Implementation
Built using Gradio applications with custom AI integrations I configured across multiple platforms. The modular design allows for easy expansion and adaptation to different learning contexts.

### Why This Matters
Organizations investing in AI need their people to actually understand these tools. GenAI Arcade demonstrates a new approach to AI literacy that could be adapted for:
- **Corporate training programs** for AI transformation initiatives
- **Executive education** on AI capabilities and limitations  
- **Client education** for technology companies
- **Public engagement** around AI policy and governance

*This project represents my approach to AI literacy: hands-on, critical, and focused on empowering people to engage effectively with AI systems.*
