## about

Most companies have invested in AI but the ROI isn't materialising. It's not the technology. The models work. It's not the teams. They're competent. It's the capability gap: the space between what AI can do and what organisations know how to do with it.

My work centres on a core principle: **better AI literacy creates better AI capabilities**. Organisations don't just need AI tools. They need people who understand where the technology actually works in their specific context, what's overhyped, and how to make it useful.

I build the infrastructure to close that gap.

## what I bring

I have 6 years of experience researching and consulting in the AI space, mostly examining the opportunities and risks of generative AI. Across my PhD, advisory work, and roles at the Education Futures Studio and QUT's GenAI Lab, I've developed expertise in AI evaluation, stakeholder management, training design, and change management. I can evaluate system architectures, write code, and make build-vs-buy recommendations, but my real value is understanding how to make AI work in organisational context.

While my background is primarily in research, I have applied experience putting this into practice through stakeholder workshops, use case discovery, and prototype development.

## how I build capability infrastructure

* **Use case discovery:** Finding where AI genuinely fits your workflows, not where vendors say it should.

* **Literacy and enablement:** Training teams to understand what AI can and can't do, so they stop chasing the wrong solutions.

* **Evaluation frameworks:** Measuring AI against what your stakeholders actually need, not generic benchmarks.

* **Translation:** Sitting between technical teams and business teams, helping both sides understand each other.

* **Champion networks:** Identifying and supporting internal advocates who drive adoption across the organisation.

## why this matters

AI performance requires both technology and team capability. Most organisations invest heavily in one, minimally in the other. The technology works. The teams are competent. But without the right infrastructure, the investment doesn't pay off.

Globally, $30-40B has gone into generative AI. Most organisations see marginal returns. The gap isn't in the models. It's in capability, adoption, and alignment.

I help close that gap.

## who I work with

I've worked with government departments, universities, investment firms, libraries, and international research organisations. Whether you're evaluating tools, figuring out where AI fits, or trying to get your teams up to speed, I can help.
