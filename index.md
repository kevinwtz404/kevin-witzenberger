# kevin witzenberger

I'm a researcher at the intersection of AI and society, with a focus on generative AI. My work centers on a simple premise: **better AI literacy creates better AI capabilities**. Organizations don't just need AI tools—they need people who can use them effectively and responsibly.

Currently a Research Fellow at QUT's GenAI Lab, affiliated investigator at the Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision Making, and co-founder of the Education Futures Studio at the University of Sydney. I hold a PhD in Science & Technology Studies from UNSW, where I investigated how artificial intelligence shapes education governance.

## What I Do

My background spans technical and social dimensions of AI. I can engage with system architectures and code, while also facilitating conversations between engineering teams and broader stakeholders. This allows me to:

- **Build AI capabilities through literacy:** Design frameworks that help organizations harness AI potential effectively
- **Bridge different perspectives:** Work across technical teams, policymakers, executives, and communities  
- **Navigate policy landscapes:** Research cited in 18 government documents (UNESCO, European Commission) 
- **Communicate across contexts:** From technical discussions to public engagement (including journalism for Spiegel.de)

## Why This Matters

Many AI implementations struggle not because of technical limitations, but because organizations lack effective engagement strategies. I work on developing the literacy frameworks that help unlock AI's potential.

Whether helping educational institutions navigate generative AI, advising governments on regulatory approaches, or building tools that help people understand AI systems—the goal is ensuring AI development works for people and communities.
