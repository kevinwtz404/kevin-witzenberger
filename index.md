## about
I'm a researcher at the intersection of AI and society, with a focus on generative AI. My work centres on a core principle: **better AI literacy creates better AI capabilities**. Organisations don't just need AI toolsâ€”they need people who understand the opportunities and risks of these technologies.

Currently a Research Fellow at QUT's GenAI Lab, affiliated investigator at the ARC CoE in Automated Decision-Making + Society, and co-founder of the Education Futures Studio at the University of Sydney. I hold a PhD in Science & Technology Studies from UNSW, where I investigated how artificial intelligence shapes education governance. I have 7 years of research experience examining the impact of AI technologies across various sectors.

## what I do

My background spans technical and social dimensions of AI. I can engage with system architectures and code, while also facilitating conversations between engineering teams and broader stakeholders. My experience includes:

* **building AI literacy through professional development:** Leading workshops for organisational professionals, creating interactive platforms, and developing curricula that help organisations implement AI while understanding its constraints
* **bridging multiple perspectives:** Working across technical teams, policymakers, end users, executives, and community stakeholders
* **establishing thought leadership:** Co-founding Education Futures Studio, developing technical democracy frameworks, and contributing to public discourse through platforms like The Conversation
* **influencing governance frameworks:** Research cited in government documents from UNESCO to the European Commission, with input to state and federal policymakers
* **communicating across contexts:** From technical discussions to public lectures, media engagement, and academic publications

## why this matters

AI implementations often fail not due to technical limitations, but because organisations struggle to distinguish between actual capabilities and inflated claims. My work focuses on creating practical frameworks that bridge this knowledge gap.

This includes establishing new approaches to AI literacy, contributing to public discourse through media engagement, and developing governance frameworks that help institutions make informed decisions about AI adoption.
