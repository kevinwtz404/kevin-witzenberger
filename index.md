## Why This Matters
Modern AI implementation isn't just a technical challengeâ€”it's a strategic one. Companies need leaders who understand both what AI can do and how to deploy it responsibly whilst navigating complex regulatory requirements. I bridge that gap.

As co-founder of the Education Futures Studio and Research Fellow at QUT's GenAI Lab, I've helped shape AI governance frameworks affecting millions of users. My background in professional journalism (Spiegel.de) and ongoing thought leadership (The Conversation) means I excel at making AI accessible to non-technical decision-makers.

Whether you're implementing AI transformation, managing regulatory compliance, or building organisational AI capabilities, I bring the unique combination of technical depth, policy expertise, and communication skills that successful AI deployment requires.
